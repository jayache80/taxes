# How to Do Your Taxes for Free

tl;dr: Use [Free File][1] for federal. For state, there's likely a completely
free method via your state's tax website.

For some reason this information is a bit "fringe", which I think speaks
volumes about the amount of fuckery that the tax preparation and tax software
industries are doing to the American society. As if the overcomplicated tax
code wasn't bad enough, it seems the average person doesn't know that they can
file their taxes for *free* ("free" as in "don't pay any service fee to
actually file the tax return"). I've seen many friends get conned into paying
stupid and unnecessary fees when using proprietary tax software, and it doesn't
have to be that way.

Remember:

* Don't use TurboTax, no matter how "free" you may believe it is.
* Don't use TaxAct, no matter how "free" you may believe it is.
* Don't use {insert proprietary tax software here}, no matter how "free" you
  may believe it is, *at least not directly*&mdash;that is, make sure you
  arrive at one of those services [*via Free File*][1] (if you
  qualify&mdash;see below).
* Don't hire a tax preparer. Doing your taxes is something you should do
  yourself, no matter how complicated you may think it is. While it's true that
  the tax preparation industry has single-handedly lobbied for a more and more
  complex tax code, that's not necessarily a reason to hire an overpriced tax
  professional (unless your tax situation is so complicated that you need their
  assistance, which is arguably *not* the case for most people). I am not a
  financial advisor nor an expert on tax code. This is not financial or tax
  advice.

## Federal
Start here: [irs.gov/freefile][1]. You're presented with a decision to make:

1. If you made less money than some arbitrary cutoff (canonically $79k at
   the time of this writing, but it may differ from tax prep offer to offer)
   in the tax year then you can use an [IRS Free File Offer][4]. This gives you
   a plethora of offers to choose from which are proprietary wizard-based tax
   prep software. This is provided by companies (like Intuit, who makes
   TurboTax) that participate in the Free File Alliance to satisfy an agreement
   with the IRS to provide an *actually free* way to file taxes. It's been
   shown that [Intuit tried to hide this free offering's existence from
   the web][6]! They really don't want you to use it... So, use it! Browsing
   the offers should look something like this:

   ![Free File offers](free-file-offers.png)

   If you made more money than the arbitrary cutoff, then you'll have to use
   "fillable forms". However, I argue you should use "fillable forms" anyway
   because it's best to fill the forms out yourself, so you understand exactly
   what's going on with your taxes.

1. If you can't (or don't want to) use a Free File offer of a wizard-based tax
   prep software above, then use [freefilefillableforms.com][2]. Go there and
   start the process. You have to make an account, which self-destructs by the
   end of the year (so even if you've made an account before, you'll likely
   have to make a new one). The landing page should look something like this:

   ![Free File Fillable Forms](ffff.png)

   This website is the only official, *truly free* way for those who make more
   than the arbitrary cutoff ($79k at the time of this writing) to file their
   taxes in a somewhat modern way (as opposed to filling out the forms in ink
   and mailing them). Essentially, you're just filling out a raw 1040 PDF (and
   any additional forms) but in such a way that you're able to e-file for free
   when you're done.

   > website, so they probably collect data. If data privacy is your number one
   > concern, it's recommended to fill out your taxes with paper and ink and
   > mail them directly to the IRS.

   It helps if you have your previous tax forms handy (which you probably need
   anyway) to use as a reference when filling out what is essentially the raw
   1040 (and any additional forms you add along the way).

## State
If your state requires filing state income taxes, as most do, you'd normally
file them after completing the federal form 1040 first. Even if you did not
follow the above, but instead stumbled upon a "free" way to e-file your federal
tax return using proprietary services, moving onto the state portion is often
where such a service may require you to pay an unnecessary fee. Don't fall for
their trick! Most states have a completely free way to file your state income
taxes too, so abandon that proprietary service at this juncture even if you've
already e-filed the federal portion through them.

> Further, you may have to [e-file your federal and state income taxes both

After you've e-filed your federal taxes, use your state's companion to Free
File (if offered). For California, that's [CalFile][3], which is part of the
Franchise Tax Board (FTB). Go there and make a "basic" account, which should be
enough to get the job done. Or, if you already have an account (from a previous
year) log into that existing account&mdash;MyFTB accounts are not
self-destructing like Free File Fillable Forms accounts are. The landing page
should look something like this:

![CalFile](calfile.png)

Once you're in, it's intuitive to fill out the form (540 in the case of
California) with a "wizard" workflow and it e-file it when you're done.

Here are some state websites where you should be able to file your state taxes
for free.
